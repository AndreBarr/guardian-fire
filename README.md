## Scripts

- `start`: starts the Go http server
- `copy:htmx`: copies the minified htmx js file from node_modules and moves it to the static folder (this is required so that the http server has access to the file)
- `css:watch`: watches for changes in the **styles.css** file and generates a css file with tailwind
